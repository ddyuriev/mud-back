чем плох async ajax
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12615169/is-there-any-way-to-wait-for-ajax-response-and-halt-execution/12615282

A quick explanation of why I say it's wrong to turn off async:

Turning off async will freeze the browser while waiting for the ajax call. The user cannot click on anything,
cannot scroll and in the worst case, if the user is low on memory, sometimes when the user drags the window off the screen
 and drags it in again he will see empty spaces because the browser is frozen and cannot redraw.
For single threaded browsers like IE7 it's even worse: all websites freeze!
Users who experience this may think you site is buggy.
If you really don't want to do it asynchronously then just do your processing in the back
end and refresh the whole page. It would at least feel not buggy.
